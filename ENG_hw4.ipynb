        "\n",
        "Your task is to analyze a dataset containing transaction history of UK-based and registered non-store online retail store [1].\n",
        "Please execute the following tasks based on the purchase data. Follow the preprocessing steps as described below. When submitting, your code should include only the sections from steps 2 to 6.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both the [dataset itself](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/352/online+retail.zip) and its [description](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail) are available online.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the downloaded and preprocessed (see section 2) data, `target_online_retail_data_tb`, write a function that processes and returns the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Calculate Total Purchase Amount per Customer:**\n",
        "    - Compute the total purchase amount for each customer (`CustomerID`) by summing the `TotalPrice` values.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Sort Customers in Descending Order:**\n",
        "    - Sort the customers based on their total purchase amounts in descending order.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Group Customers into $n$ Equal Parts:**\n",
        "    - Without changing the sorted order, divide the customers into $n$ groups of equal size.\n",
        "        - $n$ is a natural number (i.e., a positive integer) that does not exceed the number of data points that does not cause any splitting point to fall exactly on duplicate values.\n",
        "        - If the number of data points is not perfectly divisible by $n$, use the behavior of `pd.qcut()` to handle the grouping.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Calculate Revenue Proportion for Each Group:**\n",
        "    - For each group, calculate the percentage of the overall revenue (total purchase amount) that the group represents.\n",
        "        - This approach is known as decile analysis when $n$ equals 10, but the method applies generally for any valid $n$.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Sort Groups by Sales Proportion in Descending Order:**\n",
        "    - Sort the groups in descending order based on their sales proportions and label them as \"Group 1\", \"Group 2\", ..., \"Group n\". Return the result as a `pandas.Series`.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Additional Background:**<br>\n",
        "In marketing strategy, dividing customers into segments is called segmentation, and focusing on the top 20% of customers is known as **targeting**. Often, targeting premium customers leads to a higher return on investment. This concept is related to the **Pareto Principle**, which states that roughly 80% of the sales come from the top 20% of customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Submission Guidelines:**<br>\n",
        "When submitting your solution, only submit the entire `homework()` function. Submit by selecting this week's assignment in the Omnicampus homework section, pasting the function into the submission area, and then clicking [Submit Python Code].\n",
        "\n",
        "Please pay attention to the following points when submitting.\n",
        "- Erase the `!!WRITE ME!!` when submitting\n",
        "- Do **NOT** change the preprocessing cell (see section 2)\n",
        "- The return value of the function should be type `pandas.Series`\n",
        "    - e.g. `my_result = pd.Series([0.6, 0.2, 0.1, 0.025, 0.025, 0.022, 0.021, 0.02, 0.01, 0])`\n",
        "    - The sales proportions should be ordered by group, and the total should sum to 1."
